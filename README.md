# MovieBookingAPIs


Developed a backend Movie Booking Application enabling users to view a full movie list, add new movies with unique IDs, and retrieve specific movie information by ID. Implement strong error handling for duplicate IDs and non-existent movies. It is a smooth and dependable platform for managing movie data while maintaining data integrity across the system.
